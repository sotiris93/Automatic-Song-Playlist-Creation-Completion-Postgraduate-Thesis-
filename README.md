# Automatic-Song-Playlist-Creation-Completion-Postgraduate-Thesis-

Abstract

The aim of this dissertation is to develop a recommendation system which will create an 
automatic playlist of songs in the open (without a set date of completion) competition Spotify 
Million Playlist Dataset Challenge, in order to understand the musical tastes of the user and to 
predict music tracks which he desires. It is a continuation of the previous RecSys Challenge 
2018 which lasted from January to July 2018. This is achieved as follows: A title of a playlist 
or an initial set of songs is inserted in a playlist and then the system predicts the next songs in 
this playlist. The Spotify Million Playlist Dataset Challenge consists of a training set from 
which data is extracted regarding the users' musical preferences and a challenge set (test set) 
which contains playlists of songs that contain incomplete data. This data set consists of 
1,000,000 playlists created by users of the Spotify platform between January 2010 and October 
2017. It is intended for research use in music recommender systems. The companies that use 
the recommender systems aim to increase their sales by taking advantage of the personalized 
offers and the improved customer experience they offer. The recommendations facilitate the 
user's access to the content he is interested in and suggest the appropriate products based on 
their preferences. The implementation of the programming part of the dissertation was done in 
Python programming language and emphasis was placed on modeling the problem of creating 
a playlist by creating recommendations that make the best use of the available data. This system 
uses machine learning methods and in particular techniques applied to recommender systems. 
The data used was collected from the website www.aicrowd.com and relates to playlists created 
by users of the Spotify music service.
